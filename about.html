  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is <strong>Tom</strong>, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in fluid dynamics at London University. My research focuses on computational modeling, particularly in the area of pore network modeling, and its applications to understanding salt precipitation and carbonate formation in porous media.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to my academic work, I enjoy collaborating with colleagues and researchers, and I am always exploring new ways to improve my understanding of theoretical and computational physics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of research, I am passionate about gaming and enjoy building Pokémon card decks—currently focusing on Ghost-type Pokémon. I'm also working on developing my GitHub repositories and sharing useful resources for students and researchers in the field.
